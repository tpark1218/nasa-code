# nasa-code

This code was written by Tony Park at NASA Headquarters during the 2018 NASA Summer Internship. Since the NASA's Satellite Observations of Arctic Change website does not have much quantitative data, I thought it would be helpful for both scientists/public who may want to analyze and find trends/anomalies of the data themselves by uploading a code template that helps them do so. Since I was only given Air temperature and Water Vapor data to work with, the examples in my code only revolves around them. However, if given the same type of data file (.nc4), anyone can easily change the file name and get their own result.

During my internship, I was able to pull up visual data, label them so it is easy to comprehend, and even compare the graphs to see how they correlate with each other.

Beginning this code was very difficult personally, but by providing what I have created publicly, I hope it will make it much easier and convenient for others!
